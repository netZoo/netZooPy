        Description:
            Initialization of the condor object. The function gets a network in edgelist format as a path to a file or encoded in a pandas dataframe.
            Builds a condor_object with an edgelist,an igraph network, names of the targets and regulators.
            
            Note: The edgelist is assumed to contain a bipartite network. The program will relabel the nodes so that the edgelist represents a bipartite network anyway.
            It is on the user to know that the network they are using is suitable for the method.
        Inputs:
            network_file: Path to file encoding an edgelist.
            sep: Separator used in the file.
            index_col: Column that stores the index of the edgelist. E.g. None, 0...
            header: Row that stores the header of the edgelist. E.g. None, 0...
            dataframe: Pandas DataFrame containing the edgelist. 
        Outputs:
            condor_object is built with the following variables:
            net: Contains the network edgelist as a pandas DataFrame.
            graph: iGraph object containing the bipartite network.
            reg_names: list of the nodes in the first column.
            tar_names: list of the nodes in the second column.
            index_dict: dictionary keeping track of the indices in the "graph" variable and the actual names of the nodes.

    """
        Description:
            Computation of the whole condor process. It creates a condor object and runs all the steps of BRIM on it. The function outputs 
            
            Note: The edgelist is assumed to contain a bipartite network. The program will relabel the nodes so that the edgelist represents a bipartite network anyway.
            It is on the user to know that the network they are using is suitable for the method.
        Inputs:
            network_file: Path to file encoding an edgelist.
            sep: Separator used in the file.
            index_col: Column that stores the index of the edgelist. E.g. None, 0...
            header: Row that stores the header of the edgelist. E.g. None, 0...
            initial_method: Method to determine intial community assignment. (By default Multilevel method).
            initial_project: Whether to project the network onto one of the bipartite sets for the initial community detection.
            com_num: Max number of communities. It is recomended to leave this to default, otherwise if the initial community assignement is bigger the program will crash.
            deltaQmin: Difference modularity threshold for stopping the iterative process.
            resolution: Not yet implemented.
            return_output: Whether the function returns the created condor object.
            tar_output: Filename for saving the tar node final membership.
            reg_output: Filename for saving the reg node final membership.
        
        Outputs:
            condor_object (if return_output=True)
            Files "tar_memb.txt" and "reg_memb.txt" encoding the final tar and reg node membership.
